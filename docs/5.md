quickly!

## Information from the Event

Add some additional information such as:

- What HTTP method was used

## Content Types

Return a JSON body if requested

## Add a Second Route

Add a route that response to GET requests at `/event` which returns the
incomming event structure.  For ease, always return JSON.
