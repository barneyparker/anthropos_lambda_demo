# Deploying What We Have
[ << Step 0](./0.md)

We have some code, but we dont have anything in AWS - lets fix that now!

## Create a Plan

At the command line, run:

```
make
```

Several things happen during this phase:

- Terraform initialises the directory
- Retrieves any required Terraform provider plug-ins (as specified in `meta.tf`)
- Retrieves local copies of any remote modules (the `api` module from `api.tf`
in our case)
- Retirieves a copy of the current state file
- Formats the code to ensure a consistent style
- Parses the code for syntax errors
- Creates the directed graph of resources
- Determines the order of operations required to meet the state defined in the
code

The output shows what Terraform will do:

- Resources to be added will be prefixed with `+`
- Resources to be removed will be prefixed with `-`
- Resources to be modified in-place will be prefixed with `~`
- Resources which will need to be destroyed and re-created will be prefixed with
`-/+`

finally a simmary will be printed:

```
Plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

Wherever possible Terraform will try to show you the value that will be assigned
to an attribute.  Where it is unable to it will show `(known after apply)`.  For
example the `api_address` output cannot be known until the API has been created,
hence it wont be known until the apply step has been completed

## Apply the plan

If having reviewed the plan you are happy with the actions Terraform is
suggesting, enter the following command:

```
make apply
```

Terraform will now attempt to make the required changes to make the real world
match the code definition.  If there are any issues it will report them, and if
everything completes as expected it will report:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Assuming the `apply` was successful, Terraform should print a summary of what
happened, and its outputs:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

api_address = "https://<your_name>.sandbox.anthropos.io"
```

## Visiting our API

If you enter the URL in the `api_address` output you should get a response from
your API!

Unfortunately right now we haven't told the API how to handle requests of any
type, so you should get a `404` response with a `content-type` of
`application/json` which looks something like this:

```
{
  message: "Not Found"
}
```
